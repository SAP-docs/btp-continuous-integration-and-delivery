## Use

At the moment, SAP offers three different solutions that help you apply CI/CD in your software development:

-   [**SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery**](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/CONTINUOUS_DELIVERY/Cloud/en-US)

    SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery is a service on SAP BTP, which lets you configure and run predefined continuous integration and delivery pipelines that build, test, and deploy your code changes. It supports the development of SAP Cloud Application Programming Model, SAP Fiori, SAP Cloud Integration and container-based applications projects.

    For more information, see [Meet Our New Continuous Integration and Delivery Solution](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/08/17/meet-our-new-continuous-integration-and-delivery-solution/).

-   **[Project "Piper"](https://www.project-piper.io/)**

    Project "Piper" is an open-source project that provides preconfigured Jenkins pipelines, which you can use in your own Jenkins infrastructure and adapt according to your needs, if necessary. It consists of two components:

    -   A [shared library](https://github.com/SAP/jenkins-library), which contains the description of steps, scenarios, and utilities required to use Jenkins pipelines

    -   A [set of Docker images](https://github.com/SAP/devops-docker-images) that can be used to implement best practice processes


-   **[Continuous Integration and Delivery Best Practices Guide](https://help.sap.com/viewer/3324745951b44b578bd65221d2ff8f9a/Cloud/en-US)**

    The CI/CD Best Practices Guide provides best practice procedures to implement continuous delivery pipelines on any CI/CD stack and demonstrates how to apply the principles of CI/CD to SAP-specific technologies.

    For more information, see [Weâ€™ve Finished Our Renovations: Our New CI/CD Best Practices](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/02/20/weve-finished-our-renovations-our-new-ci-cd-best-practices/).


All three solutions differ in their level of flexibility and expertise required for setup and configuration:

As you don't need to care about the underlying infrastructure, SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery requires the least expertise in CI/CD. Therefore, however, its flexibility is limited. Project "Piper" Docker images can be used out-of-the-box. As this offering depends on Jenkins, however, its flexibility is also restricted. The Continuous Integration and Delivery Best Practices Guide works with any CI/CD stack, but therefore requires more expertise in CI/CD.
