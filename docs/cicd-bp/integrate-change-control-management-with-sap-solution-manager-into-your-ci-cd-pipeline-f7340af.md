# Integrate Change Control Management with SAP Solution Manager into Your CI/CD Pipeline

Add change control management processes to your CI/CD pipeline and facilitate the synchronization of changes made both on-premise and on SAP BTP.

> ### Tip:  
> If you use Jenkins or plan to use it, have a look at the [**project "Piper"**](https://www.project-piper.io) scenario [Build and Deploy Hybrid Applications with Jenkins and SAP Solution Manager](https://www.project-piper.io/scenarios/changeManagement/), instead.

For a full overview of the different solutions SAP provides for CI/CD, see [SAP Solutions for Continuous Integration and Delivery](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8cacec64ed854b2a88e9a0973e0f97a2/Cloud/en-US/e9fa320181124fa9808d4446a1bf69dd.html).

## Context

Change control management features help you create change requests, edit them, if necessary, and implement changes. You can choose between two different options, which you can integrate into your CI/CD pipeline:

-   **Quality Gate Management**

    Quality Gate Management is an out-of-the-box solution that helps you monitor all software change processes, distribute software across systems and technology stacks, and get an overview of the implementation of changes to your SAP software solution. For more information, see [Quality Gate Management](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8b923a2175be4939816f0981b73856c7/LATEST/en-US/a90473a0d3f74adcaa6c6b4be7635867.html).

-   **Change Request Management**

    Change Request Management allows you to manage your projects in SAP Solution Manager from end to end: Plan your change management and project, manage your resources, and physically transport changes from the development environment into the productive one. Change Request Management with SAP Solution Manager is highly customizable. For more information, see [Change Request Management](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8b923a2175be4939816f0981b73856c7/LATEST/en-US/4c3acb82b50843b4e10000000a42189e.html).
