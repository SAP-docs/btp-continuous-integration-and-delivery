# SAP Fiori in the Neo Environment

Configure a CI/CD pipeline for the development of SAPUI5/SAP Fiori applications in the Neo environment.



You can choose between two options to configure an SAP Fiori in the Neo environment job:

-   [**Configure an SAP Fiori in the Neo Environment Job in the Job Editor**](configure-an-sap-fiori-in-the-neo-environment-job-in-the-job-editor-619a864.md#loio619a864813584bd1a433cafac1fb0c1e)

    Configure the stages of your SAP Fiori in the Neo environment job directly in the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service.

-   [**Configure an SAP Fiori in the Neo Environment Job in Your Repository**](configure-an-sap-fiori-in-the-neo-environment-job-in-your-repository-4f6185c.md#loio4f6185c3282b4e998fd7d1b202b14615)

    Configure the stages of your SAP Fiori in the Neo environment job in your source code management system.


> ### Tip:  
> Configuring an SAP Fiori in the Neo environment job as code in the source repository is more advanced than configuring it with the job editor in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, but also provides more flexibility. You can start with editor-based configuration and switch to configuration in the source repository when it becomes necessary.
