# SAP Fiori in the Cloud Foundry Environment

Configure a CI/CD pipeline for the development of SAPUI5/SAP Fiori applications in the Cloud Foundry environment.

> ### Caution:  
> This pipeline type is deprecated. Please use the [Cloud Foundry Environment](cloud-foundry-environment-7c2a049.md) pipeline with the mta build tool, instead. All existing jobs will be migrated automatically.



You can choose between two options to configure an SAP Fiori in the Cloud Foundry environment job:

-   [**Configure an SAP Fiori in the Cloud Foundry Environment Job in the Job Editor**](configure-an-sap-fiori-in-the-cloud-foundry-environment-job-in-the-job-editor-201ef60.md#loio201ef608e14c4ca483b2184b42e17e7f)

    Configure the stages of your SAP Fiori in the Cloud Foundry environment job directly in the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service.

-   [**Configure an SAP Fiori in the Cloud Foundry Environment Job in Your Repository**](configure-an-sap-fiori-in-the-cloud-foundry-environment-job-in-your-repository-03814e2.md#loio03814e24e992470cbda2b066a221d239)

    Configure the stages of your SAP Fiori in the Cloud Foundry environment job in your source code management system.

    > ### Tip:  
    > Configuring an SAP Fiori in the Cloud environment job as code in the source repository is more advanced than configuring it with the job editor in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, but also provides more flexibility. You can start with editor-based configuration and switch to configuration in the source repository when it becomes necessary.
