# Container-Based Applications

Configure a CI/CD pipeline for the development of container-based applications.

You can choose between two options to configure a container-based applications job:

-   [**Configure a Container-Based Applications Job in the Job Editor**](https://help.sap.com/viewer/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/Cloud/en-US/87cf47a7820d4a00abd8a8526366c129.html)

    Configure the stages of your container-based applications job directly in the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service.

-   [**Configure a Container-Based Applications Job in Your Repository**](https://help.sap.com/viewer/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/Cloud/en-US/355204259a90412d86cfc043e504a91f.html)

    Configure the stages of your container-based applications job in your source code management system.


> ### Tip:  
> Configuring a container-based applications job as code in the source repository is more advanced than configuring it with the job editor in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, but also provides more flexibility. You can start with editor-based configuration and switch to configuration in the source repository when it becomes necessary. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Export Job Configuration Data](https://help.sap.com/viewer/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/Cloud/en-US/60a76d7b5a2a46f684515b18e9cbbc08.html).
