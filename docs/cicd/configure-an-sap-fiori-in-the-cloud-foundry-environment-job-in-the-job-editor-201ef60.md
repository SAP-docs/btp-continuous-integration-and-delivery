# Configure an SAP Fiori in the Cloud Foundry Environment Job in the Job Editor

Configure the stages of your SAP Fiori in the Cloud Foundry environment job directly in the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service.



<a name="loio201ef608e14c4ca483b2184b42e17e7f__prereq_dvs_hg3_xlb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You’re an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Assigning Roles and Permissions](assigning-roles-and-permissions-c679ebd.md).

-   In your source code management system, you have an SAPUI5/SAP Fiori project for the Cloud Foundry environment. See [Create an SAP Fiori Project](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/Cloud/en-US/46664de4d6944471b6c29a0681bfd0fc.html).


> ### Note:  
> The SAP Fiori in the Cloud Foundry environment pipeline also supports HTML5 applications that don't need an own runtime infrastructure. For more information, see [Developing HTML5 Applications](https://help.sap.com/viewer/d1c8cd7a39bc4f24a0c65e2ae64d627c/1.0/en-US/00b074c1284e4520a75df52e25698522.html).

## Procedure

1.  In SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, configure a new job as described in [Create a Job](create-a-job-d748920.md). As *Pipeline*, choose *SAP Fiori in the Cloud Foundry environment*.

2.  In the *Stages* tab, choose *Job Editor* from the *Configuration Mode* dropdown list.

    > ### Note:  
    > After you have configured your job, you can export the editor-based configuration information to a YAML file by pressing the YML button. Press *Edit* and switch to *Source Repository* to move from editor-based configuration to the more advanced configuration in the source repository when necessary. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Export Job Configuration Data](https://help.sap.com/viewer/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/Cloud/en-US/60a76d7b5a2a46f684515b18e9cbbc08.html).

3.  In the *Stages* tab, perform the following actions:

    1.  Configure the *Build* stage.

## \(Optional\) Configure the Additional Unit Test Stage

Before running the **Additional Unit Tests** stage in your job, add the test configuration to your project.



<a name="loio642bcb08b27c4d7ab5008aa277225189__prereq_fgb_ctn_blb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You’re an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.

-   In your repository, you have an SAPUI5/SAP Fiori project. See [Create an SAP Fiori Project](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/Cloud/en-US/46664de4d6944471b6c29a0681bfd0fc.html).




<a name="loio642bcb08b27c4d7ab5008aa277225189__steps_kmn_qtn_blb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Make sure that the following dependencies and scripts are part of your `package.json` file:

    ```
    {
        (...)
        "devDependencies": {
            (...)
            "karma": "^5.0.4",
            "karma-chrome-launcher": "^3.1.0",
            "karma-coverage": "^2.0.2",
            "karma-ui5": "^2.1.0"
        },
        "scripts": {
            (...)
            "test": "karma start",
        }
    }
    ```

2.  To describe that the tests should use a custom web driver launcher to connect to a remote Chrome browser, add a file named `karma.conf.js` to the same folder as your `package.json` file.

3.  Add the following minimal configuration to your `karma.conf.js` file:

    ```
     ```
     module.exports = function(config) {
         config.set({
            frameworks: ["ui5"],
            ui5: {
               url: "https://ui5.sap.com"
            },
            browsers: ["ChromeHeadless"],
            browserConsoleLogOptions: {
               level: "error"
            },
            singleRun: true
         });
     };
     ```
    
    ```

4.  To report the coverage and see the coverage data in the logs, add the following additional configuration to the file:

    ```
    ```
    module.exports = function(config) {
      config.set({
    
        frameworks: ["ui5"],
        ui5: {
          url: "https://ui5.sap.com"
        },
        preprocessors: {
    			"{webapp,webapp/!(test)}/!(mock*).js": ["coverage"]
    		},
        coverageReporter: {
                includeAllSources: true,
                reporters: [
                    {
                        type: "html",
                        dir: "coverage"
                    },
                    {
                        type: "text"
                    }
                ],
        check: {
           each: {
                   statements: <THRESHOLD>,
                   branches: <THRESHOLD>,
                   functions: <THRESHOLD>,
                   lines: <THRESHOLD>
                    }
                }
            },
         reporters: ["progress", "coverage"],
    
        browsers: ["ChromeHeadless"],
        browserConsoleLogOptions: {
             level: "error"
        },
        singleRun: true
      });
    };
    ```					
    ```

    For `<THRESHOLD>`, enter the percentage of your code that you want to cover with tests. If the defined threshold isn’t met, the build breaks.

## \(Optional\) Integrate SAP Cloud Transport Management into Your Pipeline

Upload your artifact to SAP Cloud Transport Management to implement a continuous delivery process for your project.



<a name="loio0b9c5d30aff3425c96a440dce60bd9c7__prereq_jst_qjl_3fb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have access to the SAP Cloud Transport Management service. See [Provide Access to SAP Cloud Transport Management](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/13894bed9e2d4b25aa34d03d002707f9.html).

-   You have set up the SAP Cloud Transport Management service. See [Set Up the Environment to Transport Content Archives directly in an Application](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/8d9490792ed14f1bbf8a6ac08a6bca64.html).

-   You’ve created a destination in the Cloud Foundry environment for each productive subaccount to which you want to transport an archive. See [Create Transport Destinations](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/c9905c142cf14aea86fe2451434faed9.html).


> ### Note:  
> In the following procedure, we assume a 2-stage landscape that consists of a development and production subaccount. However, it’s also valid for landscapes with more stages, if you define the additional nodes within the transport route accordingly.



<a name="loio0b9c5d30aff3425c96a440dce60bd9c7__context_ejk_yxj_kfb"/>

## Context

With **Build** and **Deploy** stages only, your pipeline only deploys to one space in the Cloud Foundry or subaccount in the Neo environment. A full-fledged continuous delivery process, however, requires a staged landscape with several spaces or subaccounts \(for example, development and production or development, test, and production\). With SAP Cloud Transport Management, you can define nodes and routes for such a staged landscape. For more information, see [Use the Transport Landscape Wizard](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/f14192ede8ac4603955b572537d6bec2.html).

When combining SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery and SAP Cloud Transport Management, after being built, the artifact is deployed to your space or subaccount and, in an additional step in the job, uploaded to SAP Cloud Transport Management. The export of the multitarget application archive \(MTAR\) triggers its transport along the transport route you’ve defined. When it has reached the import queue of the production node, the release manager manually triggers its import to the production node in the user interface of SAP Cloud Transport Management.

The following graphic shows this procedure:

  
  
**Integration of SAP Cloud Transport Management**

![Integration of the Transport Management Service](images/TMS_Integration_a844e6e.png "Integration of SAP Cloud Transport Management")

Working with the integration of SAP Cloud Transport Management comprises the following steps:

1.  Push your code changes to your source code management system or manually trigger a new build in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.

2.  SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery builds, tests, and deploys your changes, and uploads them to SAP Cloud Transport Management. The artifact appears in the import queue.

3.  Validation tests are executed on the application deployed in your QA node.

4.  The release manager approves the import by selecting the transport to be imported.

5.  The application is released to the production node.


To integrate SAP Cloud Transport Management into SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, perform the following tasks:

<a name="task_zvp_q25_blb"/>

<!-- task\_zvp\_q25\_blb -->

### Create the Service Key Credential

<a name="task_zvp_q25_blb__steps_cgp_z25_blb"/>

## Procedure

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, navigate to the subaccount in which you’ve created an instance for SAP Cloud Transport Management.

2.  From the navigation area, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> *Spaces* and select your space in which you’ve created the Cloud Transport Management instance.

3.  From the navigation area, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> *Services* \> *Instances*.

4.  Choose the name of your service instance.

5.  From the navigation area, choose :key: *Service Keys*.

6.  Copy the entire service key.

7.  In SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, create a new Service Key credential and paste the copied service key into the respective text field. See [Creating Credentials](creating-credentials-6658c81.md).

8.  When creating a job, use the newly created Service Key credential in the *Upload to Cloud Transport Management* stage.

    For the *Node Name*, see the following section.


<a name="task_rdg_pn5_blb"/>

<!-- task\_rdg\_pn5\_blb -->

### Create the Transport Nodes and Route

Create nodes for your spaces or subaccounts, connect them through a transport route, and provide the respective data to SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.



<a name="task_rdg_pn5_blb__steps_g3s_sn5_blb"/>

## Procedure

1.  In SAP Cloud Transport Management, create a node for each of your development and production spaces or subaccounts. See [Create Transport Nodes](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/f71a4d5550cd453ea824d5b5c677969d.html).

2.  Connect the nodes through a transport route. See [Create Transport Routes](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/dddb74937a014aea8d3d76d740180597.html).

3.  In your job configuration in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, enter the name of your development node in the *Upload to SAP Cloud Transport Management* stage.

4.  When you've finished your job creation, choose *Add*.
