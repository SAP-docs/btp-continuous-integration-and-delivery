## Prerequisites

> ### Restriction:  
> This pipeline only works for on-premises scenarios.

-   You've set up SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Initial Setup](initial-setup-719acaf.md).

-   You're assigned the Administrator role for SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Assigning Roles and Permissions](assigning-roles-and-permissions-c679ebd.md).

-   In your source code management system, you have an SAPUI5/SAP Fiori project for the ABAP platform. See [Create an SAP Fiori Project](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/Cloud/en-US/46664de4d6944471b6c29a0681bfd0fc.html).

-   You have configured the SAP Cloud Connector to ensure secure communication between SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery and the ABAP system.

-   You have installed the SAP component SAP\_UI 7.53 or higher on your ABAP system. See [Software Component SAP\_UI](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/6f3c61a7a5b94447b80e72f722b0aad7/35828457ed26452db8d51c840813f1bb.html?version=202009.002).

## Context

SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery offers predefined CI/CD pipelines for SAP-specific development scenarios. These pipelines consist of various stages, which are tasks executed sequentially. Your own configuration of a pipeline, including the stages you activate, is referred to as a 'job'.

Depending on your configuration, your job for ABAP platform scenarios can include the following stages:

> ### Tip:  
> Hover over the arrow shapes for a brief description of each stage.

![](images/UI5_Pipeline_Steps_ad534be.png)

Configuring jobs in your repository involves the initial job creation and configuration in the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery job editor as well as the stages and steps configuration in your source repository.

> ### Tip:  
> Expand the following sections for more information.

<a name="task_l2k_cwc_3bc"/>

<!-- task\_l2k\_cwc\_3bc -->

## Initial Configuration \(Job Editor\)

Create a job in the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery job editor.



<a name="task_l2k_cwc_3bc__steps_frk_3wc_3bc"/>

## Procedure

1.  In the *Jobs* tab in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, choose :heavy_plus_sign:.

2.  In the *Job Name* text field, enter a unique name for your job.

    > ### Tip:  
    > We recommend a name that contains both the name and the branch of your project in your source code management system.

3.  In the *Description* text field, enter a meaningful description for your job.

4.  Choose the *Repository* text field to open the *Select Repository* pop-up.

    Either choose your repository from the list or choose *Add Repository* to add your project repository to SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Add a Repository](add-a-repository-fc55872.md).

5.  In the *Branch* text field, enter the branch from which you want to receive push events.

    You can also configure a job for multiple branches in your repository. See [Configure a Multi-Branch Job](configure-a-multi-branch-job-d52d3ca.md).

6.  From the *Pipeline* drop-down list, choose *SAP Fiori for ABAP platform*.

7.  Skip the *Version* drop-down list.

    If you create a new job, the latest version is selected by default. If you edit an existing job, you can change the version by choosing an option from the drop-down list.

8.  To enable your job, choose *ON*.

    By choosing *OFF*, you can deactivate your job without deleting its configuration.

    > ### Note:  
    > Jobs that are created in a trial account or using the Free service plan are automatically deactivated after remaining unchanged for one week. You can use this switch to reactivate them.

9.  In the *Keep logs for* text field in the *Build Retention* section, enter the number of days after which your builds are automatically deleted. Choose a range between 1 and 28 days.

10. In the *Keep maximum* text field, enter the maximum number of builds you want to keep. If your number of builds exceeds this maximum, the oldest ones are deleted automatically. Choose a range between 1 and 99 builds.

11. From the *Configuration Mode* drop-down list, choose *Source Repository*.

12. \(Optional\) Either switch the option *Send Build Notifications via SAP Alert Notification Service* on or off.

    > ### Note:  
    > To use the *Send Build Notifications via SAP Alert Notification Service* option, you need to have enabled the SAP Alert Notification service and created a service key to authenticate your job against it. See [Initial Setup](https://help.sap.com/docs/alert-notification/sap-alert-notification-for-sap-btp/initial-setup?version=Cloud) and [Credential Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/alert-notification/sap-alert-notification-for-sap-btp/credential-management?version=Cloud).

    If you turn on the *Send Build Notifications via SAP Alert Notification Service* option, provide the following information:

    1.  To authenticate your job against SAP Alert Notification service, create a Service Key credential. See [Creating Credentials](creating-credentials-6658c81.md).

        In the *Service Key* text field, enter the already created service key of your Alert Notification service instance.

        Choose this service key credential from the *Service Key* drop-down list.


13. To save your initial job configuration, choose *Create*.

<!-- task\_v5j\_c5p\_ybc -->

#### Configure the Additional Unit Tests Stage

Before running the Additional Unit Tests stage in your job, add the Karma test configuration to your project.



<a name="task_v5j_c5p_ybc__context_m4x_m5p_ybc"/>

## Context

The following steps introduce [Karma](https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSAP%2Fkarma-ui5), which is a plugin that helps test your SAP Fiori project.



<a name="task_v5j_c5p_ybc__steps_ndy_p5p_ybc"/>

## Procedure

1.  Append the following Karma dependencies to your project:

    ```
    npm install --save-dev karma karma-ui5 karma-chrome-launcher karma-coverage
    ```

2.  Append the following Karma script to your `package.json` file:

    ```
    {
        (...)
        "scripts": {
            (...)
            "test": "karma start"
        }
    }
    ```

3.  To load and test the project, add a file called `karma.conf.js` to the same folder as your `package.json` file.

4.  Add the following minimal configuration to your `karma.conf.js` file:

    ```
    module.exports = function(config) {
        config.set({
            frameworks: ["ui5"],
            ui5: {
                configPath: "ui5-mock.yaml". // change to ui5.yaml if ui5-mock.yaml does not exist.
            },
            browsers: ["ChromeHeadless"],
            customLaunchers: {
                ChromeHeadlessCustom: {
                    base: 'ChromeHeadless',
                    flags: ['--window-size=1920,1080']
                }
            },
            browserConsoleLogOptions: {
                level: "error"
            },
            singleRun: true,
            proxies: {
                '/base/webapp/resources': 'http://127.0.0.1:' + config.port + '/resources',
                '/base/webapp/test-resources': 'http://127.0.0.1:' + config.port + '/test-resources'
            }
        });
    };
    ```

    > ### Note:  
    > The `ui5` property is configured using `configPath`, which loads the default SAPUI5 resources. If a mock server is later added to the project, the `configPath` should be updated to `ui5-mock.yaml`. See [Installing MockServer](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/253805578f04461a9741983a630ce4f1.html?locale=en-USstate%3DPRODUCTION).

5.  To validate your configuration, run the new test script:

    ```
    npm run test
    ```

    In the console log, you can see that the ChromeHeadless browser is now connected, but as you havenâ€™t added a test plan, yet, no tests were executed.

## Next Steps

To add unit and integration tests to your project, refer to the [SAPUI5 Overview and Testing Strategy Guide](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/ab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5).
