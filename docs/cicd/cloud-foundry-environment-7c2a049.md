# Cloud Foundry Environment

Configure a CI/CD pipeline for the development of applications that follow the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model in the Cloud Foundry environment.

You can choose between two options to configure a Cloud Foundry Environment job:

-   [**Configure a Cloud Foundry Environment Job in the Job Editor**](configure-a-cloud-foundry-environment-job-in-the-job-editor-6bd27c0.md#loio6bd27c07ee3b428f9ad5a2e89084f3a3)

    Configure the stages of your Cloud Foundry Environment job directly in the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service.

-   [**Configure a Cloud Foundry Environment Job in Your Repository**](configure-a-cloud-foundry-environment-job-in-your-repository-bfe48a4.md#loiobfe48a4b12ed41868f92fa564829f752)

    Configure the stages of your Cloud Foundry Environment job in your source code management system.


> ### Tip:  
> Configuring a Cloud Foundry Environment job as code in the source repository is more advanced than configuring it with the job editor in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, but also provides more flexibility. You can start with editor-based configuration and switch to configuration in the source repository when it becomes necessary.
