## Prerequisites

-   You're an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Assigning Roles and Permissions](assigning-roles-and-permissions-c679ebd.md).

-   You have a Bitbucket Server repository, which you've added to SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Add a Repository](add-a-repository-fc55872.md).

## Context

A webhook with Bitbucket Server allows you to automate SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery builds: Whenever you push changes to your Bitbucket Server repository, a webhook push event is sent to the service to trigger a build of the connected job.
