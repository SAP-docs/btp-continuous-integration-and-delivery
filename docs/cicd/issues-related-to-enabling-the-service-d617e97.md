# Issues Related to Enabling the Service

Learn how to handle issues related to the enablement of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.



## Context

You want to enable SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery as described in [Enabling the Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery/sap-continuous-integration-and-delivery/enabling-service?language=en-US). However, you can't view the Continuous Integration & Delivery tile in the Service Marketplace.



## Solution

Make sure that you have one of the following licenses:

-   If you’re a **customer**, you need to use the CPEA \(Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement\) license model. See [What Is the Consumption-Based Commercial Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/7047eb4a15a84ac7be3c8612179e6d1f.html).

-   If you’re a **partner**, you need a Test, Demonstration, and Development License. See [SAP Partner Licensing Services](https://partneredge.sap.com/en/partnership/licenses/tdd.html).
