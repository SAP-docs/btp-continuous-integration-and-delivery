# Manage Timed Triggers for Jobs

Configure a job to be automatically triggered according to schedules.



<a name="loio3cd830ec08644e52b47cc3274732aacd__prereq_stg_5hw_pqb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You’re an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Assigning Roles and Permissions](assigning-roles-and-permissions-c679ebd.md).

-   You have an existing job in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Configuring a Job](administering-jobs-d581ab5.md).




## Procedure

1.  In the detail view of your job in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, navigate to the *Timed Triggers* tab.

2.  To create a new timed trigger, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> \(More\) ** \> ** :heavy_plus_sign:.

3.  In the *Create Timed Trigger* pop-up, enter the following values:

    Enter a cron schedule expression to define the recurrence condition of the build. For more information, see [Cron Schedule Syntax](manage-timed-triggers-for-jobs-3cd830e.md#loiob38912b3e5a54e04a6d32c58357f1d1b).

    > ### Note:  
    > The minimal interval between two triggers is 5 minutes.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
4.  Choose *Create*.




<a name="loio3cd830ec08644e52b47cc3274732aacd__result_vgz_szy_cpb"/>

## Results

You’ve defined recurring schedules to execute the build of your job. At every scheduled time, a build for a specific branch will be created accordingly.

## Next Steps

You can perform the following further actions for the newly created timed trigger:

-   To edit a timed trigger, select your timed trigger and choose *Edit*.
-   To delete a timed trigger, select your timed trigger and choose *Delete*.

    > ### Note:  
    > When you delete a job, you also delete all timed triggers created for that job.

## Cron Schedule Syntax

Use cron expressions to define the recurrence condition of your job.



A cron expression is a string comprised of five fields separated by a white space. The allowed values for each field are the following:

```
# ┌───────────── Minute (0 - 59)
# │ ┌───────────── Hour (0 - 23)
# │ │ ┌───────────── Day of the Month (1 - 31)
# │ │ │ ┌───────────── Month (1 - 12) 
# │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── Day of the Week (0 - 7) (Sunday to Saturday) (Sunday = 0 or 7)
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ │
# * * * * *

```

> ### Note:  
> Apart from the numeric values for the **Month** and **Day of the Week** field, upper, lower and alternating case three-letter abbreviations are allowed. For example,`jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, or dec`in the **Month** field and`mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, or sun`in the **Day of the Week** field.

To configure each field, you can also use one of the following options:

-   Ranges and lists:

    -   Use a range of numbers separated by a hyphen \(-\). The specified range is inclusive.

        For example, to specify a runtime between 8:00 and 11:00, the range of the **Hour** field would be `8-11`.

    -   Use a list of numbers or ranges separated by commas.

        For example, if you enter `1-4,8-10` in the **Day of the Month** field, the job will be executed on the first, second, third, fourth, eighth, ninth and tenth days of the month.





-   Unrestricted ranges:

    Use an asterisk \(\*\) to run every instance of the value of the field.

    For example, an asterisk in the **Month** field runs the job every month.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can specify the job execution day both in the **Day of the Month** and **Day of the Week** field. If both fields are restricted by the use of a value other than the asterisk, the command will run when either field matches the current time. For example, the value `30 4 1,15 * 5` will execute the job at 4:30 AM on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> of each month and on every Friday.

-   Step values:

    Use step values in conjunction with ranges. Enter `/` after a range to specify which values to use in the range.

    For example, to specify the execution of the job every other hour, use `0-23/2` in the **Hour** field. This expression is equivalent to the value`0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22`.

    You can also use steps after an asterisk. If you want to run the job every two hours, use `*/2`.


Examples of cron patterns are described in the following table:

</table>

For example, the cron expression`0 0 13 * 5`schedules a build for each Friday at midnight \(UTC\), as well as the 13<sup>th</sup> of each month at midnight \(UTC\).
