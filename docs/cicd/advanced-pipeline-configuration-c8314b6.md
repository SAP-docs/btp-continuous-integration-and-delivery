# Advanced Pipeline Configuration

Enhance the stages of your SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery jobs with advanced pipeline configuration.

You can provide the following additional configuration to the stages of your SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery jobs:

-   [Additional Commands](additional-commands-c05a252.md), which are additional command steps to be executed in the beginning or at the end of a given stage.

-   [Additional Credentials](additional-credentials-af2d1a2.md), which are environment variables that store values injected from credentials.

-   [Additional Variables](additional-variables-74fe540.md), which are environment variables that store user-defined strings.


You can implement advanced pipeline configuration either using the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery job editor or using the configuration file in your source code management system.

> ### Note:  
> You can use this feature for all scenarios listed in [Supported Pipelines](supported-pipelines-e293286.md) except for [SAP Integration Suite Artifacts](sap-integration-suite-artifacts-019ed68.md).
