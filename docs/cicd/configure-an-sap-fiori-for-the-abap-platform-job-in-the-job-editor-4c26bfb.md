## Prerequisites

-   You’re an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Assigning Roles and Permissions](assigning-roles-and-permissions-c679ebd.md).

-   In your source code management system, you have an SAPUI5/SAP Fiori project for the ABAP platform. See [Create an SAP Fiori Project](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/Cloud/en-US/46664de4d6944471b6c29a0681bfd0fc.html).

-   You have configured the SAP Cloud Connector to ensure secure communication between SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery and the ABAP system.

-   You have installed the SAP component SAP\_UI 7.53 or higher on your ABAP system. See [Software Component SAP\_UI](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/6f3c61a7a5b94447b80e72f722b0aad7/35828457ed26452db8d51c840813f1bb.html?version=202009.002).

-   You have enabled the OData service to load data to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository. See [Using an OData Service to Load Data to the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/a883327a82ef4cc792f3c1e7b7a48de8.html).

-   You have the S\_DEVELOP authorization to perform operations in your SAPUI5 ABAP repository. See [Using an OData Service to Load Data to the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/a883327a82ef4cc792f3c1e7b7a48de8.html).

## Context

Depending on your configuration, the SAP Fiori for the ABAP platform pipeline can comprise the following stages:

> ### Tip:  
> Hover over the arrow shapes for a short description of each stage.

![](images/ABAP_Platform_Stages_216f127.png)

> ### Note:  
> Upon the completion of your pipeline’s run, an additional *Declarative: Post Actions* stage is executed to perform finalization tasks. The outcome of the *Declarative: Post Actions* stage does not influence the success of your build.



<a name="loio4c26bfbeb6444805a933ca48a470b217__steps_yz5_sh3_xlb"/>

## Procedure

1.  In SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, configure a new job as described in [Create a Job](create-a-job-d748920.md). As *Pipeline*, choose *SAP Fiori for ABAP platform*.

2.  In the *Stages* tab, choose *Job Editor* from the *Configuration Mode* dropdown list.

    > ### Note:  
    > After you have configured your job, you can export the editor-based configuration information to a YAML file by pressing the YML button. Press *Edit* and switch to *Source Repository* to move from editor-based configuration to the more advanced configuration in the source repository when necessary. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Export Job Configuration Data](https://help.sap.com/viewer/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/Cloud/en-US/60a76d7b5a2a46f684515b18e9cbbc08.html).

3.  In the *Stages* tab, perform the following actions:

    1.  Configure the *Build* stage.

## \(Optional\) Configure the Additional Unit Test Stage

Before running the **Additional Unit Tests** stage in your job, add the test configuration to your project.



<a name="loio642bcb08b27c4d7ab5008aa277225189__prereq_fgb_ctn_blb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You’re an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.

-   In your repository, you have an SAPUI5/SAP Fiori project. See [Create an SAP Fiori Project](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/Cloud/en-US/46664de4d6944471b6c29a0681bfd0fc.html).




<a name="loio642bcb08b27c4d7ab5008aa277225189__steps_kmn_qtn_blb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Make sure that the following dependencies and scripts are part of your `package.json` file:

    ```
    {
        (...)
        "devDependencies": {
            (...)
            "karma": "^5.0.4",
            "karma-chrome-launcher": "^3.1.0",
            "karma-coverage": "^2.0.2",
            "karma-ui5": "^2.1.0"
        },
        "scripts": {
            (...)
            "test": "karma start",
        }
    }
    ```

2.  To describe that the tests should use a custom web driver launcher to connect to a remote Chrome browser, add a file named `karma.conf.js` to the same folder as your `package.json` file.

3.  Add the following minimal configuration to your `karma.conf.js` file:

    ```
     ```
     module.exports = function(config) {
         config.set({
            frameworks: ["ui5"],
            ui5: {
               url: "https://ui5.sap.com"
            },
            browsers: ["ChromeHeadless"],
            browserConsoleLogOptions: {
               level: "error"
            },
            singleRun: true
         });
     };
     ```
    
    ```

4.  To report the coverage and see the coverage data in the logs, add the following additional configuration to the file:

    ```
    ```
    module.exports = function(config) {
      config.set({
    
        frameworks: ["ui5"],
        ui5: {
          url: "https://ui5.sap.com"
        },
        preprocessors: {
    			"{webapp,webapp/!(test)}/!(mock*).js": ["coverage"]
    		},
        coverageReporter: {
                includeAllSources: true,

                    },
                    {
                        type: "text"
                    }
                ],
        check: {
           each: {
                   statements: <THRESHOLD>,

                }
            },
         reporters: ["progress", "coverage"],
    
        browsers: ["ChromeHeadless"],
        browserConsoleLogOptions: {
