# Configure an SAP Fiori for the ABAP Platform Job in the Job Editor

Configure the stages of your SAP Fiori for the ABAP platform job directly in the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service.

## Prerequisites

-   You’re an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Assigning Roles and Permissions](assigning-roles-and-permissions-c679ebd.md).

-   In your source code management system, you have an SAPUI5/SAP Fiori project for the ABAP platform. See [Create an SAP Fiori Project](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/Cloud/en-US/46664de4d6944471b6c29a0681bfd0fc.html).

-   You have configured the SAP Cloud Connector to ensure secure communication between SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery and the ABAP system.

-   You have installed the SAP component SAP\_UI 7.53 or higher on your ABAP system. See [Software Component SAP\_UI](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/6f3c61a7a5b94447b80e72f722b0aad7/35828457ed26452db8d51c840813f1bb.html?version=202009.002).

-   You have enabled the OData service to load data to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository. See [Using an OData Service to Load Data to the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/a883327a82ef4cc792f3c1e7b7a48de8.html).

-   You have the S\_DEVELOP authorization to perform operations in your SAPUI5 ABAP repository. See [Using an OData Service to Load Data to the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/a883327a82ef4cc792f3c1e7b7a48de8.html).

## Context

Depending on your configuration, the SAP Fiori for the ABAP platform pipeline can comprise the following stages:

> ### Tip:  
> Hover over the arrow shapes for a short description of each stage.

![](images/ABAP_Platform_Stages_216f127.png)

> ### Note:  
> Upon the completion of your pipeline’s run, an additional *Declarative: Post Actions* stage is executed to perform finalization tasks. The outcome of the *Declarative: Post Actions* stage does not influence the success of your build.



<a name="loio4c26bfbeb6444805a933ca48a470b217__steps_yz5_sh3_xlb"/>

## Procedure

1.  In SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, configure a new job as described in [Create a Job](create-a-job-d748920.md). As *Pipeline*, choose *SAP Fiori for ABAP platform*.

2.  In the *Stages* tab, choose *Job Editor* from the *Configuration Mode* dropdown list.

    > ### Note:  
    > After you have configured your job, you can export the editor-based configuration information to a YAML file by pressing the YML button. Press *Edit* and switch to *Source Repository* to move from editor-based configuration to the more advanced configuration in the source repository when necessary. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Export Job Configuration Data](https://help.sap.com/viewer/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/Cloud/en-US/60a76d7b5a2a46f684515b18e9cbbc08.html).

3.  In the *Stages* tab, perform the following actions:

    1.  Configure the *Build* stage.

## \(Optional\) Configure the Additional Unit Test Stage

Before running the **Additional Unit Tests** stage in your job, add the Karma test configuration to your project.

<a name="loio642bcb08b27c4d7ab5008aa277225189__prereq_fgb_ctn_blb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You’re an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.

-   In your repository, you have an SAPUI5/SAP Fiori project. See [Create an SAP Fiori Project](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-fioriapps-create.html).

-   Google Chrome installed, runnung headless Chrome is a way to run the Chrome browser in a headless environment without the full browser UI.

<a name="loio642bcb08b27c4d7ab5008aa277225189__steps_kmn_qtn_blb"/>

## Procedure

The following steps will introduce [Karma](https://github.com/SAP/karma-ui5), a plugin to help test your SAPUI5 project.

1.  Append the following Karma dependencies to your project:

    ```BASH
    npm install --save-dev karma karma-ui5 karma-chrome-launcher karma-coverage
    ```
    
2.  Append the following Karma script to your `package.json`:   

    ```JSON
    {
        (...)
        "scripts": {
            (...)
            "test": "karma start"
        }
    }
    ```

3.  In order to load and test the project, add a file called `karma.conf.js` to the same folder as your `package.json` file.

4.  Add the following minimal configuration to your `karma.conf.js` file:
   
     ```JS
        module.exports = function(config) {
            config.set({
               frameworks: ["ui5"],
               ui5: {
                 configPath: "ui5.yaml"
               },    
               browsers: ["ChromeHeadless"],
               customLaunchers: {
                 ChromeHeadlessCustom: {
                     base: 'ChromeHeadless',
                     flags: ['--window-size=1920,1080']
                 }
             },
               browserConsoleLogOptions: {
                  level: "error"
               },
               singleRun: true,
               proxies: {
                 '/base/webapp/resources': 'http://127.0.0.1:' + config.port + '/resources',
                 '/base/webapp/test-resources': 'http://127.0.0.1:' + config.port + '/test-resources'
                 }
            });
        };
     ```

    The `ui5` property is configured using `configPath` which is loading the default UI5 resources. If a mock server is later added to the project, the `configPath` should be updated to `ui5-mock.yaml` to reflect this new configuration, refer to [Installing MockServer Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/253805578f04461a9741983a630ce4f1.html?locale=en-USstate%3DPRODUCTION)
     
5. To validate everything is working, run the new `test` script;

     ```BASH
     npm run test
     ```

    Review the console log, the ChromeHeadless browser is now connected but no tests were executed since we haven't added a test plan yet.
    
6. Refer to the [SAPUI5 Overview and Testing Strategy Guide](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/ab134ef3932c4b42898c79c10341e8b5) to add a unit and integration tests to your project.
