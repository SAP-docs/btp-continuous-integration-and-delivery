## Prerequisites

-   You’re an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Assigning Roles and Permissions](assigning-roles-and-permissions-c679ebd.md).

-   You've provisioned the Cloud Integration capability as part of SAP Integration Suite. See [Initial Setup of SAP Cloud Integration in the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/302b47b11e1749c3aa9478f4123fc216.html).
-   You've created the *Process Integration Runtime* service instance of plan *api* and a service key to authenticate your pipeline against SAP Cloud Integration. See [Setting Up OAuth Inbound Authentication with Client Credentials Grant for API Clients, Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/20e26a837a8449c4b8b934b07f71cb76.html).
-   You’ve transferred your integration artifacts from SAP Cloud Integration to a repository of your source code management system.

    Procedure:

    1.  In SAP Cloud Integration, open your integration package and choose *Artifacts*.

    2.  Choose *Actions*→ *Download*.

    3.  Save the \*.zip file to your choice of destination.

    4.  Extract the file and upload its contents into your repository.

        > ### Note:  
        > Repeat the procedure in case you make changes in your integration flow in SAP Cloud Integration.

> ### Note:  
> Upon the completion of your pipeline’s run, an additional *Declarative: Post Actions* stage is executed to perform finalization tasks. The outcome of the *Declarative: Post Actions* stage does not influence the success of your build.

## Procedure

1.  In SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, configure a new job as described in [Create a Job](https://help.sap.com/viewer/SAP-Cloud-Platform-Continuous-Integration-and-Delivery/d748920175554221be1ba8b461ada030.html). As *Pipeline*, choose *SAP Integration Suite Artifacts*.

2.  In the *Stages* tab, choose *Job Editor* from the *Configuration Mode* dropdown list.

    > ### Note:  
    > After you have configured your job, you can export the editor-based configuration information to a YAML file by pressing the YML button. Press *Edit* and switch to *Source Repository* to move from editor-based configuration to the more advanced configuration in the source repository when necessary. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Export Job Configuration Data](https://help.sap.com/viewer/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/Cloud/en-US/60a76d7b5a2a46f684515b18e9cbbc08.html).
