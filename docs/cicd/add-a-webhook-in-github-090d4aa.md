<a name="loio090d4aaa9628426b91c90e8284213040__prereq_uqr_xly_ykb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You're an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Assigning Roles and Permissions](assigning-roles-and-permissions-c679ebd.md).

-   You have a GitHub repository, which you've added to SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Add a Repository](add-a-repository-fc55872.md).

-   You've added a webhook event receiver for your repository and you know the secret from your webhook credential. See [Add a Repository](add-a-repository-fc55872.md).




## Context

A webhook with GitHub allows you to automate SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery builds: Whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository, a webhook push event is sent to the service to trigger a build of the connected job.

The following graphic illustrates this flow:
