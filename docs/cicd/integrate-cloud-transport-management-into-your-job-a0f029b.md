# Integrate Cloud Transport Management into Your Job

Implement a continuous delivery process by integrating the SAP Cloud Transport Management functionality into your job.



<a name="loioa0f029b80e054eb0afd0adb0900d4c19__prereq_n4d_gnz_y1c"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You’ve either set up SAP Cloud Transport Management or SAP Cloud ALM. SAP Cloud ALM includes SAP Cloud Transport Management. See [Initial Setup of SAP Cloud Transport Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-transport-management/sap-cloud-transport-management/initial-setup) or [Required Setup for SAP Cloud ALM](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/setup-administration/required-setup).

-   You've set up an instance for the corresponding service and service key or service binding. See [SAP Cloud Transport Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-transport-management/sap-cloud-transport-management/creating-service-instance-and-service-key?version=Cloud) or [SAP Cloud ALM](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/setup-administration/enabling-sap-cloud-alm-api).

-   You’ve created a destination in the Cloud Foundry environment for each productive subaccount to which you want to transport an archive. See [Create Transport Destinations](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-transport-management/sap-cloud-transport-management/create-transport-destinations).




## Context

The SAP Cloud Transport Management service lets you define nodes and routes for a staged landscape with several spaces or subaccounts, which is needed for full-fledged continuous delivery process.

The following video provides an overview of how to integrate the SAP Cloud Transport Management functionality into an SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery job:



There are two ways to use the cloud transport management functionality together with SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery: You can either connect your job with SAP Cloud Transport Management itself or with SAP Cloud ALM, which includes the cloud transport management service.

> ### Note:  
> Depending on which option you choose, expand one of the following sections for more information.

## Connect Your Job with SAP Cloud Transport Management

In the Release stage of your job, select your preferred transport operation and create a service key credential to connect to SAP Cloud Transport Management.



<a name="concept_hxf_qnz_y1c__section_i22_tnz_y1c"/>

## Transport Operation

If you connect your job with the SAP Cloud Transport Management service, you can choose between two different *Transport Operation* options: *Export from* and *Upload to*.

  
  
**Transport Operations with SAP Cloud Transport Management**

![Transport Operations with SAP Cloud Transport Management](images/TMS_Operations_9d45dce.png "Transport Operations with SAP Cloud Transport Management")



### Export from:

If you choose the *Export from* transport operation, the following tasks are executed in the Release stage of your job:

1.  SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery accesses SAP Cloud Transport Management through a Service Key credential. For more information, see [Service Key](https://help.sap.com/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery/continuous-integration-and-delivery-internal/integrate-cloud-transport-management-into-your-job?state=DRAFT#service-key).

2.  The mtar file that has been created in the Build stage of your job is added to a transport request. This transport request can’t be changed anymore.

3.  The transport request containing the mtar file is exported from the export node and added to the import queue of the following node. In the example graphic, it is exported from the development node and added to the import queue of the quality assurance node.


If you choose *Export from* as transport operation, enter the name of the export node into the text field next to *Transport Operation* in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.



### Upload to:

If you choose the *Upload to* transport operation, the following tasks are executed in the Release stage of your job:

1.  SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery accesses SAP Cloud Transport Management through a Service Key credential. For more information, see [Service Key](https://help.sap.com/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery/continuous-integration-and-delivery-internal/integrate-cloud-transport-management-into-your-job?state=DRAFT#service-key).

2.  The mtar file that has been created in the Build stage of your job is added to a transport request within the upload node in SAP Cloud Transport Management. In the example graphic, it is added to a transport request within the development node.


If you choose *Upload to* as transport operation, enter the name of the upload node into the text field next to *Transport Operation* in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.

## Service Key

Create a Service Key credential to authenticate your job against SAP Cloud Transport Management.



### Procedure

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, navigate to the subaccount in which you’ve created an instance for SAP Cloud Transport Management.

2.  From the navigation area, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> *Spaces* and select the space in which you’ve created the SAP Cloud Transport Management instance.

3.  From the navigation area, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> *Services* \> *Instances*.

4.  Choose the name of your service instance.

5.  From the navigation area, choose :key: *Service Keys*.

6.  Copy the entire service key.

7.  In SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, create a new Service Key credential and paste the copied service key into the respective text field. See [Creating Credentials](creating-credentials-6658c81.md).

## Connect Your Job with SAP Cloud ALM

In the Release stage of your job, select the transport operation and create a service key credential to connect to SAP Cloud ALM.



<a name="concept_ztz_trz_y1c__section_lrn_ztz_y1c"/>

## Transport Operation

If you connect your job with SAP Cloud ALM to access the SAP Cloud Transport Management functionality, choose *Export from* as *Transport Operation*.

With this transport operation, the following tasks are executed in the Release stage of your job:

  
  
**Transport Operation with SAP Cloud ALM**

![Transport Operation with SAP Cloud ALM](images/TMS_with_SAP_Cloud_ALM_df57d96.png "Transport Operation with SAP Cloud ALM")

1.  SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery accesses SAP Cloud ALM through a Service Key credential. For more information, see [Service Key](https://help.sap.com/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery/continuous-integration-and-delivery-internal/integrate-cloud-transport-management-into-your-job?state=DRAFT#service-key-0).

2.  SAP Cloud ALM establishes the connection with SAP Cloud Transport Management.

3.  The mtar file that has been created in the Build stage of your job is added to a transport request. This transport request can’t be changed anymore.

4.  The transport request containing the mtar file is exported from the export node and added to the import queue of the following node. In the example graphic, it is exported from the development node and added to the import queue of the quality assurance node.


Enter the name of the export node into the text field next to *Transport Operation* in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.
