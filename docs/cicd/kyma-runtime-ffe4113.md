# Kyma Runtime

Configure a CI/CD pipeline for the development of applications that follow the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model in the Kyma runtime.

You can choose between two options to configure a Kyma runtime job:

-   **[Configure Kyma Runtime Job in the Job Editor](configure-kyma-runtime-job-in-the-job-editor-0700ecb.md)**

    Configure the stages of your Kyma runtime job directly in the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service.

-   **[Configure a Kyma Runtime Job in Your Repository](configure-a-kyma-runtime-job-in-your-repository-9f1c1e2.md)**

    Configure the stages of your Kyma Runtime job in your source code management system.


> ### Tip:  
> Configuring an SAP Cloud Application Programming Model job as code in the source repository provides more flexibility, but is more advanced than configuring it with the job editor in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. You can start with editor-based configuration and switch to configuration in the source repository when it becomes necessary. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Export Job Configuration Data](https://help.sap.com/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery/sap-continuous-integration-and-delivery/export-job-configuration-data?version=Cloud).
