# Running and Monitoring CI/CD Jobs

Trigger the build of a continuous integration and delivery job and monitor its outcome.



<a name="loiodb8521cc85924f78b7e92b1ea69fdf94__prereq_srz_q2v_zkb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have connected your Git repository with SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Add a Repository](add-a-repository-fc55872.md).

-   \(Optional\) You have configured a webhook between your repository and SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery to automate your builds.

-   You have configured a job for your Git repository and branch. See [Configuring Jobs](configuring-jobs-e293286.md).




<a name="loiodb8521cc85924f78b7e92b1ea69fdf94__steps_ahx_x2v_zkb"/>

## Procedure

1.  To run your job, choose one of the following options:

    -   If you've configured a webhook between your repository and SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, create a code change and push it to your repository. Thereby, your source code management system sends a push event to SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, which runs a job.

    -   In the *Jobs* tab in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, choose the job for which you want to trigger a build and choose *Run*.


    After a few seconds, a new tile appears in the *Builds* view of your job. Depending on the status of your build, the tile is marked with one of the following icons:
