# Configuring Jobs

Customize an SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline.

Currently, SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery offers predefined CI/CD pipelines for the following use cases:

-   [**Cloud Foundry Environment**](configure-a-cloud-foundry-environment-job-6bd27c0.md#loio6bd27c07ee3b428f9ad5a2e89084f3a3)

-   [**SAP Fiori for ABAP Platform**](configure-an-sap-fiori-for-the-abap-platform-job-4c26bfb.md#loio4c26bfbeb6444805a933ca48a470b217)

-   [**SAP Integration Suite Artifacts**](configure-an-sap-integration-suite-artifacts-job-3d5573f.md)

-   [**Kyma Runtime**](configure-a-kyma-runtime-job-0700ecb.md)


There are two ways to configure jobs in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery: You can either use the built-in **job editor** in the service user interface, which is our recommended approach, or you can configure it in your **source repository**.

The repository configuration is more advanced than the job editor configuration, but also provides more flexibility. See [Configuring Jobs in Your Repository](configuring-jobs-in-your-repository-af397b1.md).

> ### Note:  
> You can also start with an editor-based configuration and switch to the repository configuration, if necessary. See [Export Job Configuration Data](export-job-configuration-data-60a76d7.md).
