# SAP Integration Suite Artifacts

Configure a CI/CD pipeline for the development of integration content in SAP Cloud Integration.

You can choose between two options to configure an SAP Integration Suite Artifacts job:

-   [**Configure an SAP Integration Suite Artifacts Job in the Job Editor**](https://help.sap.com/viewer/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/Cloud/en-US/3d5573fab2ea432cb2cab8639395e51e.html)

    Configure the stages of your SAP Integration Suite Artifacts job directly in the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service.

-   [**Configure an SAP Integration Suite Artifacts Job in Your Repository**](https://help.sap.com/viewer/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/Cloud/en-US/3daf56d952c74c10b0be810d082e68ab.html) 

    Configure the stages of your SAP Integration Suite Artifacts job in your source code management system.


> ### Tip:  
> Configuring an SAP Integration Suite Artifacts job as code in the source repository is more advanced than configuring it with the job editor in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, but also provides more flexibility. You can start with editor-based configuration and switch to configuration in the source repository when it becomes necessary. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Export Job Configuration Data](https://help.sap.com/viewer/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/Cloud/en-US/60a76d7b5a2a46f684515b18e9cbbc08.html).
