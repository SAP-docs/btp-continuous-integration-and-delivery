## Pipeline, Stage, and Step

SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery offers predefined CI/CD pipelines for SAP-specific development scenarios. Each **pipeline** consists of various **stages**, that is, tasks \(such as build, integration test, or deploy\), which are executed one after the other. Stages are subdivided into several subtasks, which are referred to as **steps**.

## Job and Build

Before using an SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline, you configure it according to your needs. This configuration does not only include the choice of the pipeline type that fits your scenario, but also the selection and adaption of the stages you want it to execute. A configured and thus customized pipeline is called **job**. See [Configuring Jobs](configuring-jobs-e293286.md).

If a job is triggered, the [stages](concepts-707017c.md#loio707017c681aa4bc09d0279f08115dcae__section_dxw_cp3_qnb) youâ€™ve configured are executed in a row. Each execution of a job is referred to as **build**.

## Webhook

A build can either be triggered manually in the service user interface or automatically through changes in your source code management repository. To automate your pipeline so that it runs a build with every commit that is made, you need to establish a **webhook** between SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery and your source repository. This webhook sends a push event whenever a change is pushed and thereby triggers a build of the connected job. See [Creating Webhooks](creating-webhooks-a273cff.md).
