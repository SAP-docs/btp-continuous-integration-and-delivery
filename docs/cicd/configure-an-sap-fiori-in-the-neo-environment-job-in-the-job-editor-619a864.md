> ### Note:  
> Upon the completion of your pipeline’s run, an additional *Declarative: Post Actions* stage is executed to perform finalization tasks. The outcome of the *Declarative: Post Actions* stage does not influence the success of your build.



<a name="loio619a864813584bd1a433cafac1fb0c1e__steps_yz5_sh3_xlb"/>

## Procedure

1.  In SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, configure a new job as described in [Create a Job](create-a-job-d748920.md). As *Pipeline*, choose *SAP Fiori in the Neo Environment*.

2.  In the *Stages* tab, choose *Job Editor* from the *Configuration Mode* dropdown list.

    > ### Note:  
    > After you have configured your job, you can export the editor-based configuration information to a YAML file by pressing the YML button. Press *Edit* and switch to *Source Repository* to move from editor-based configuration to the more advanced configuration in the source repository when necessary. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Export Job Configuration Data](https://help.sap.com/viewer/99c72101f7ee40d0b2deb4df72ba1ad3/Cloud/en-US/60a76d7b5a2a46f684515b18e9cbbc08.html).

3.  In the *Stages* tab, perform the following actions:

    1.  Configure the *Build* stage.

## Enable the Build and Additional Unit Tests Stages

Set up the **Build** and **Additional Unit Tests** stages of your SAP Fiori in the Neo environment job.



<a name="loio708413d4c586409489cbb17d1fbe1e5c__prereq_dvs_hg3_xlb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You’re an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Assigning Roles and Permissions](assigning-roles-and-permissions-c679ebd.md).

-   In your repository, you have an SAPUI5/SAP Fiori project for the Neo environment.




## Context

The **Build** and **Additional Unit Tests** stages of an SAPUI5 module are controlled by the `package.json` and `Gruntfile.js` files. For projects that are based on the Cloud Foundry environment, these files are expected in each HTML5 module defined in the `mta.yaml` file.

> ### Note:  
> **Prepare Your Project** is also relevant if you want your pipeline to execute the **Build** task only.



## Procedure

1.  Make sure that the following dependencies and scripts are defined in the `package.json` file:

    ```
    {
        (...)
        "devDependencies": {
            (...)
            "@sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-build": "^1.4.1",
            "@sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-test": "^2.0.1"
        },
        "scripts": {
            (...)
            "test": "grunt unit_and_integration_tests"
        }
    }
    ```

2.  Make sure that the `Gruntfile.js` file contains the following calls for the registration of tasks:

    ```
    module.exports = function(grunt) {
        "use strict";
        grunt.loadNpmTasks("@sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-build");
        grunt.registerTask("default", [
            "clean",
            "lint",
            "build"
        ]);
        grunt.loadNpmTasks("@sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-test");
        grunt.registerTask("unit_and_integration_tests", ["test"]);
        grunt.config.merge({
            coverage_threshold: {
                statements: <THRESHOLD>,
                branches: <THRESHOLD>,
                functions: <THRESHOLD>,
                lines: <THRESHOLD>
            }
        });
    };
    ```

    For `<THRESHOLD>`, enter the percentage of your code that you want to cover with tests.

    > ### Note:  
    > If the defined threshold isn’t met, the build breaks.

<!-- loio52bc22233ef84527bc409fbe748947b8 -->

## \(Optional\) Configure the Deploy Credential

If you want your pipleline to execute the **Deploy** task, create an OAuth credential for the subaccount to which you want to deploy your application.



<a name="loio52bc22233ef84527bc409fbe748947b8__prereq_ltt_3qk_ylb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You’re an administrator of SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Assigning Roles and Permissions](assigning-roles-and-permissions-c679ebd.md).

-   You’ve enabled the Solutions Lifecycle Management service.




<a name="loio52bc22233ef84527bc409fbe748947b8__steps_txg_rxn_blc"/>

## Procedure

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, navigate to the subaccount in the Neo environment to which you want to deploy your application.

2.  In the navigation area, choose :shield: *Security* \> *OAuth*.

3.  In the *Platform API* tab, choose *Create API Client*.

4.  In the *Description* text field, enter a name for your API client.

5.  Select *Solutions Lifecycle Management*.

6.  Choose *Save*.

7.  Remember the *Client ID* and *Client Secret*.

    > ### Caution:  
    > Both *Client ID* and *Client Secret* are only displayed once. You can't retrieve them later.

8.  Use this *Client ID* and *Client Secret* to create a new OAuth credential in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery. See [Creating Credentials](creating-credentials-6658c81.md).

<!-- loio0b9c5d30aff3425c96a440dce60bd9c7 -->

## \(Optional\) Integrate SAP Cloud Transport Management into Your Pipeline

Upload your artifact to SAP Cloud Transport Management to implement a continuous delivery process for your project.



<a name="loio0b9c5d30aff3425c96a440dce60bd9c7__prereq_jst_qjl_3fb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have access to the SAP Cloud Transport Management service. See [Provide Access to SAP Cloud Transport Management](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/13894bed9e2d4b25aa34d03d002707f9.html).

-   You have set up the SAP Cloud Transport Management service. See [Set Up the Environment to Transport Content Archives directly in an Application](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/8d9490792ed14f1bbf8a6ac08a6bca64.html).

-   You’ve created a destination in the Cloud Foundry environment for each productive subaccount to which you want to transport an archive. See [Create Transport Destinations](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/c9905c142cf14aea86fe2451434faed9.html).


> ### Note:  
> In the following procedure, we assume a 2-stage landscape that consists of a development and production subaccount. However, it’s also valid for landscapes with more stages, if you define the additional nodes within the transport route accordingly.



<a name="loio0b9c5d30aff3425c96a440dce60bd9c7__context_ejk_yxj_kfb"/>

## Context

With **Build** and **Deploy** stages only, your pipeline only deploys to one space in the Cloud Foundry or subaccount in the Neo environment. A full-fledged continuous delivery process, however, requires a staged landscape with several spaces or subaccounts \(for example, development and production or development, test, and production\). With SAP Cloud Transport Management, you can define nodes and routes for such a staged landscape. For more information, see [Use the Transport Landscape Wizard](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/f14192ede8ac4603955b572537d6bec2.html).

When combining SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery and SAP Cloud Transport Management, after being built, the artifact is deployed to your space or subaccount and, in an additional step in the job, uploaded to SAP Cloud Transport Management. The export of the multitarget application archive \(MTAR\) triggers its transport along the transport route you’ve defined. When it has reached the import queue of the production node, the release manager manually triggers its import to the production node in the user interface of SAP Cloud Transport Management.

The following graphic shows this procedure:

  
  
**Integration of SAP Cloud Transport Management**

![Integration of the Transport Management Service](images/TMS_Integration_a844e6e.png "Integration of SAP Cloud Transport Management")

Working with the integration of SAP Cloud Transport Management comprises the following steps:

1.  Push your code changes to your source code management system or manually trigger a new build in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.

2.  SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery builds, tests, and deploys your changes, and uploads them to SAP Cloud Transport Management. The artifact appears in the import queue.

3.  Validation tests are executed on the application deployed in your QA node.

4.  The release manager approves the import by selecting the transport to be imported.

5.  The application is released to the production node.


To integrate SAP Cloud Transport Management into SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, perform the following tasks:

<a name="task_zvp_q25_blb"/>

<!-- task\_zvp\_q25\_blb -->

### Create the Service Key Credential

<a name="task_zvp_q25_blb__steps_cgp_z25_blb"/>

## Procedure

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, navigate to the subaccount in which you’ve created an instance for SAP Cloud Transport Management.

2.  From the navigation area, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> *Spaces* and select your space in which you’ve created the Cloud Transport Management instance.

3.  From the navigation area, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> *Services* \> *Instances*.

4.  Choose the name of your service instance.

5.  From the navigation area, choose :key: *Service Keys*.

6.  Copy the entire service key.

7.  In SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, create a new Service Key credential and paste the copied service key into the respective text field. See [Creating Credentials](creating-credentials-6658c81.md).

8.  When creating a job, use the newly created Service Key credential in the *Upload to Cloud Transport Management* stage.

    For the *Node Name*, see the following section.


<a name="task_rdg_pn5_blb"/>

<!-- task\_rdg\_pn5\_blb -->

### Create the Transport Nodes and Route

Create nodes for your spaces or subaccounts, connect them through a transport route, and provide the respective data to SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery.



<a name="task_rdg_pn5_blb__steps_g3s_sn5_blb"/>

## Procedure

1.  In SAP Cloud Transport Management, create a node for each of your development and production spaces or subaccounts. See [Create Transport Nodes](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/f71a4d5550cd453ea824d5b5c677969d.html).

2.  Connect the nodes through a transport route. See [Create Transport Routes](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/Cloud/en-US/dddb74937a014aea8d3d76d740180597.html).

3.  In your job configuration in SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, enter the name of your development node in the *Upload to SAP Cloud Transport Management* stage.

4.  When you've finished your job creation, choose *Add*.
